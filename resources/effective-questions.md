# Framing

How many times a week do we struggle as developers? Per day?

**Frequently!**

It is important to understand that this comes with the job and that we need to learn through these struggles. Sometimes we get stuck though, and that's ok.

As developers, we will have questions. Lots of them. One of the most important skills that we will develop over time, is **asking effective questions**. Often times, searching for the right question, will lead us the the very answer we seek in the first place.

Also, helping others is the best way to grow and cement your own knowledge base which helping to grow that community.
